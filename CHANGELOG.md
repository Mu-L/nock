Migration guides are available for major versions in the [migration guides directory](https://github.com/nock/nock/tree/main/migration_guides).

This release aim to modernize and refresh `nock`, remove long-supported hacks and create more expected library.

Breaking changes:

1. `no match` event send Request object. before it had two different signatures.
2. ClientRequest -> Request
3. All interceptor events: 'request', 'replied'
4. `replyFunction` now get a request, `interceptor` no longer contains `req` property.
5. header (matcher?) value function
6. body matcher function
7. remove `delayBody` & `delayConnection` functions, `delay` function get only one argument.
8. `this.req` no longer available, use `request` argument instead.
9. What's the point of `filteringPath` function?:q
<!-- 6. return `host` response header as node does. -->
10. Body matcher function only get the body
11. reply function only get the request

Ideas:

1. Consolidate `reply` arguments (replyFunction vs fullReplyFunction, stream, and more)
2. recorder `reqheaders` should be empty object and not undefined, also need to rename the object keys (e.g. `body` vs `response` is confusing)
3. what's the point for response in default header function (req, res, body)
4. Why do we strip the brackets in ipv6?
5. Add a reason for `no match` event

TODO:

1. fix the rawHeaders symbol in `msw/interceptors` (in `FetchResponse`) (generateRequestAndResponseObject, generateRequestAndResponse)
2. // TODO: request.headers.forEach skip a header, need to investigate it.
3. remove old lint rules and set `node:` rule:q
4. test: Host header is ignored during matching if not defined on the request
   5: test: receives the correct arguments
5. test: should delay the clock between the `response` event and the first `data` event
6. test: should abort a request with a timeout signal
